# Spleeter: Audio Source Separation Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **Spleeter**, an audio source separation library by Deezer, to isolate individual components from audio tracks, such as vocals and accompaniment.

## Features
- **Audio Source Separation**:
  - Isolates vocals and accompaniment from input audio files.
  - Supports multiple separation modes (e.g., 2 stems, 4 stems, and 5 stems).
- **Batch Processing**:
  - Processes multiple audio files efficiently in batch mode.
- **Visualization**:
  - Displays waveforms and spectrograms of separated audio components for analysis.
- **Output Management**:
  - Saves separated audio files in a user-specified directory for easy access.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Spleeter
  - Librosa
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - OS and Glob for file handling
- **Notebook Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## Results
- High-quality separation of audio sources with minimal artifacts.
- Demonstrated separation for common use cases such as karaoke tracks and instrumental extraction.
- Visualized spectrograms to compare the original and separated components.
